This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Continuous Integration

This project includes a CI workflow that runs on all pull requests and pushes to the main branch. The workflow performs the following checks:

- **ESLint**: Code quality and linting checks
- **Prettier**: Code formatting validation
- **Build**: Ensures the project builds successfully
- **Tests**: Runs the full test suite

All checks must pass before a pull request can be merged.

To run these checks locally:

```bash
# Run linting (ESLint + Prettier)
yarn lint

# Run tests
yarn test

# Build the project
yarn build
```
